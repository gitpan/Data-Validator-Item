Data/Validator/Item version 0.7
================================

VERSION 0.7 First (alpha) release

This is an attempt to create an object which will permit semi-automatic verification of a data value.

Many people work with data organised as records, each containing
(potentially many) variables. It is often necessary to process files
of such records, and to test every variable within every record to ensure that
each one is valid. I do this before putting data from very large flat files into my databases.
For each variable I had a need to define specific, sometimes complex rules for validity,
then implement them, and check them. This is what Data::Validator::Item is for.
